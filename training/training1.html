            <h1>Finger Positions</h1>
            <p>

                In their basic position, your fingers rest on the middle row of the keyboard also called the "home row". The home row is the base from which all other keys can be reached.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Now place your fingers on the home row:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Put your left hand fingers on keys ASDF (see picture).</li>

                <li> Put your right hand fingers on keys JKL;.</li>

                <li>Let the thumbs rest lightly on the space bar.</li>

                <li>Keep your wrists straight and fingers lightly curled.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Tip! Can you feel small bumps on the F and J keys? They are there to help you find the home row keys without looking at your hands.</p>
