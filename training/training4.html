            <p>Just a few more tips before moving on to the first exercise.</p>
            <p><b>Relaxed Posture</b><br>
                Sit up straight, elbows close to the body. Try to keep shoulders, arms and hands relaxed to avoid tension and discomfort.
            </p>
            <p><b>Taking Breaks</b><br>
                Take breaks between exercises to relieve tension and regain your concentration. Don't overdo training. We recommend doing only a maximum of two lessons a day.
            </p>
            <p><b>Pausing an Exercise</b><br>
                To pause an exercise, click the Pause button. Time will start running again once you resume typing.
