            <h1>Learning Tips</h1>
            <p><b>Keep Your Eyes on the Monitor</b><br>
                You will learn the key positions faster if you don't peek at the keyboard when training. If you can't remember where a key is located, check the keyboard picture on the screen to find it.
            <p><b>Keep Wrists Up</b><br>
                Keep your wrists up and straight when typing. Resting your wrists on the wrist rest or the desk will create an uncomfortable angle making it more difficult to move your fingers. This causes errors and slows you down. Holding your wrists too high has the same effect increasing the tension in the shoulders.
            </p>
            <p><b>Focus on Accuracy</b><br>
                We believe that good accuracy is the building block of fluent typing. This is why you'll have an accuracy target throughout the course. Your speed will develop over time as you continue to train and start using your typing skills on a daily basis.
